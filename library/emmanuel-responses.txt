You're still reading books? Can't you like
find that on Google or something?

You're at a library, what do you expect?

I think there might be one on the third floor
with some stale peanuts if you are willing to 
venture out.

bug
Well, you know, all software has some bugs. 
Maybe I'll look into it if I can work up
the will to care.

movie
I think uTorrent might have the movie you are
looking for. That's where I get all my movies.

iTunes might have that sorry excuse for music
if you can figure out how to use their terrible
software.
