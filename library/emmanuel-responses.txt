book
You're still reading books? Can't you like
find that on Google or something?

You're at a library, what do you expect?

vending machine
I think there might be one on the third floor
with some stale peanuts if you are willing to 
venture out.

bug
Well, you know, all software has some bugs. 
Maybe I'll look into it if I can work up
the will to care.

movie
I think uTorrent might have the movie you are
looking for. That's where I get all my movies.

album
iTunes might have that sorry excuse for music
if you can figure out how to use their terrible
software.

find
Have you seen an optomologist latley?

password
Tell me and I will do it for you. I will
also need your credit card and social security

how
Try doing the hokey pokey.
Always does the trick for me.

I am the only human in the library right now,
so direct your questions to me.

or leave and do something better with your
life than read books
